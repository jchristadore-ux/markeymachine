║  v9.7.0 — AUTONOMOUS SIZING & GOVERNORS: the bot runs on its own again.       ║
║                                                                              ║
║  The v9.4.x owner directives hard-coded a FLAT $500 stake that fired         ║
║  regardless of bankroll and stripped out the daily-loss / balance-floor      ║
║  halts. v9.7.0 hands risk management back to the bot:                        ║
║    1. kelly_bet(): stake = fractional Kelly (full_kelly × KELLY_FRACTION ×    ║
║       balance) clamped by the mode ceiling active_trade_size(), MAX_BET_      ║
║       FRACTION × balance, and cash on hand. The bet scales DOWN on its own    ║
║       as the edge weakens or the account draws down. NORMAL_TRADE_SIZE is     ║
║       now a per-trade CEILING, not a flat stake.                             ║
║    2. daily_loss_check(): the min($,%) daily-loss halt is restored.          ║
║    3. balance_floor_check(): restored (function + run_decision call).        ║
║  The 40% SESSION_STOP_FRACTION halt stays always-on. Recovery Mode +         ║
║  probation ramp (v9.5.0/v9.6.0) remain the response to a full-size loss; the ║
║  ceiling they set still binds the autonomous stake.                         ║
║                                                                              ║
║  Each switch is env-toggleable so the old flat behavior is one Railway var   ║
║  away — KELLY_SIZING / DAILY_LOSS_GUARD / BALANCE_FLOOR_GUARD (all default    ║
║  true). Set them false to restore v9.4.x. Tunables: KELLY_FRACTION (0.30),   ║
║  MAX_BET_FRACTION (0.04), MAX_DAILY_LOSS_DOLLARS, MAX_DAILY_LOSS_PCT (0.06),  ║

║  v9.6.0 — PROBATION RAMP: graduated re-entry after recovery (log-review fix).║
║                                                                              ║
║  2026-06-29 logs: the book grinds back up $100 at a time but loses $500 at a ║
║  time — one full-size loss wiped ~5 small wins and re-armed recovery. Two    ║
║  defects vs. intent ("stay small until the edge re-proves"):                 ║
║    1. Recovery EXIT snapped the base straight $100 → $500 on the next trade. ║
║       RECOVERY_LADDER_PAUSE_TRADES only held the ladder *multiplier* at 1×,  ║
║       never the base, so the stake was never kept small.                     ║
║    2. The ladder LEAKED through recovery: a $100 base × 2.0 tier placed a    ║
║       $200 trade while "in recovery."                                        ║
║                                                                              ║
║  FIX: on recovery exit the bot no longer jumps to full size — it climbs a    ║
║  ProbationState ramp of sub-full base sizes (default $100 → $250 → $500),    ║
║  advancing ONE rung on a short win streak OR a rolling win-rate threshold    ║
║  (whichever fires first) and stepping ONE rung down on any loss. Reaching    ║
║  full size graduates back to normal. Throughout recovery AND the ramp the    ║
║  laddering overlay is capped at the active base (it may size DOWN, never UP) ║
║  — closing the $200 leak. State persists to PROBATION_STATE_PATH and         ║
║  reconciles on boot. RAILWAY: PROBATION_RAMP_ENABLED (default true),         ║
║  PROBATION_WIN_STREAK (2), PROBATION_WIN_RATE_MIN (0.60), PROBATION_RUNGS    ║
║  (explicit override, e.g. "100,250"). Set PROBATION_RAMP_ENABLED=false to    ║
║  restore the old immediate snap-back to full size.                           ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║  v9.5.0 — RECOVERY MODE: two-tier position sizing (owner directive).         ║
║                                                                              ║
║  After a FULL-SIZE (normal-mode) trade settles a LOSS, the bot drops from    ║
║  NORMAL_TRADE_SIZE to RECOVERY_TRADE_SIZE and sets a recovery target = the    ║
║  realized balance recorded IMMEDIATELY BEFORE that losing trade. It keeps     ║
║  trading at the reduced size until the realized balance climbs back to the    ║
║  target, then auto-resumes full size. State {active, target} is persisted to  ║
║  RECOVERY_STATE_PATH (atomic JSON) and reconciled on boot, so an in-container ║
║  restart resumes mid-recovery and can never wedge.                           ║
║                                                                              ║
║  Sizing is derived from the mode via active_trade_size() — never read raw    ║
║  from a single env var at the sizing call. Entry is event-driven (a settled  ║
║  full-size loss → exact pre-trade target); exit is balance-driven and checked ║
║  every cycle AND on boot. A further loss while already recovering does NOT    ║
║  move the target. Entry filters / halts / streak logic unchanged.            ║
║                                                                              ║
║  RAILWAY: NORMAL_TRADE_SIZE (defaults to TRADE_SIZE_DOLLARS, so existing      ║
║  configs keep working), RECOVERY_TRADE_SIZE (default 100). For redeploy-      ║
║  durable recovery state, mount a Railway Volume and set RECOVERY_STATE_PATH   ║
║  to a path on it (e.g. /data/recovery_state.json).                           ║

║  v9.4.1 — FLAT $500 STAKE (owner directive): $500 trades fire regardless of  ║

║  v9.4.0 lifted the caps but the bet was still Kelly-scaled                   ║
║  (full_kelly × KELLY_FRACTION × balance), so $500 was only reachable around  ║
║  a $4–5k balance. kelly_bet() now uses Kelly ONLY as an edge gate (positive  ║
║  full_kelly = positive expectancy) and stakes the full TRADE_SIZE_CAP on     ║
║  every qualifying trade — no balance/Kelly/MAX_BET_FRACTION down-scaling.    ║
║  The sole clamp is cash on hand (cannot stake more than the account holds),  ║
║  so below a $500 balance the bot goes all-in. MAX_BET_FRACTION is now dead   ║

║  2. balance_floor_check() removed (function + run_decision call). No floor.  ║
║  3. RECOVERY removed: kelly_bet() no longer applies KELLY_RECOVERY_MULT and  ║

║  4. Entry-quality gates (AGREE/NEUTRAL, OB/R²/confidence/edge/Wilson) are    ║

║  DIAGNOSIS (2026-06-24 LIVE, v9.3.2): still ZERO trades. 13 cycles reached   ║
║  the gate fully aligned (e.g. KXBTC15M-...1815 climbing 74→83¢, regime       ║
║  TRENDING_UP R²=0.74–0.92, OB YES 77–97%) yet momentum returned NEUTRAL on   ║
║  every one. Root cause is structural, not the window: compute_regime() flags ║
║  TRENDING by R² (trend CONSISTENCY), but compute_momentum() required raw     ║
║  %-MAGNITUDE ≥0.15%/3min. A smooth, gentle drift has high R² but a small     ║
║  %-move, so it passes regime and fails momentum. Widening 3→6 (v9.3.2) was   ║
║  not enough; 0.15%/3min is a large move for the calm trends in these books.  ║
║                                                                              ║
║  FIX: momentum now treats a trend as REAL when EITHER the regression R² over ║
║  its window ≥ MOMENTUM_R2_MIN (default 0.55) OR the magnitude clears         ║
║  MOMENTUM_THRESH_PCT — and takes DIRECTION from the regression slope, like   ║
║  compute_regime(). BTC is "flat"/NEUTRAL only when BOTH inconsistent (low    ║
║  R²) AND small (sub-threshold) — genuine chop the doctrine still rejects.    ║

║  DIAGNOSIS (2026-06-23 LIVE session, v9.3.1): ZERO trades fired all day.     ║
║  - compute_regime() flags TRENDING over TREND_LOOKBACK=12 samples (~6 min,   ║
║    R²≥0.65). compute_momentum() measured BTC over only prices[-1] vs [-4] —  ║
║    3 samples (~90s) — and required |move|≥0.15%. A clean ~6-min trend almost ║
║    never has a single 90s slice ≥0.15%, so momentum read NEUTRAL and the     ║
║    v9.3.0 AGREE gate rejected every setup.                                   ║
║  - Logs: 34 cycles had OB depth aligned with a real trend; momentum returned ║
║    NEUTRAL on ALL of them, AGREE/CONFLICT zero times. The gate was a wall.   ║

║  FIX: momentum lookback is now MOMENTUM_LOOKBACK (default 6 ≈ 3 min), env-   ║
║  tunable. A genuine multi-minute trend now yields AGREE; flat BTC still      ║
║  reads NEUTRAL, so the doctrine intent ("never trade flat BTC") is intact —  ║
║  only the timescale momentum is measured over changed. Set MOMENTUM_LOOKBACK ║

║  ROOT CAUSE — the LIVE daily-loss circuit breaker consumed an UNREALIZED    ║
║  cash-balance delta, not realized PnL. An open position is cash-out / zero- ║
║  marked, so any single in-flight trade ≥ the daily cap trips the breaker    ║
║  before it can settle. This is the mirror image of the v9.3.0 phantom-WIN   ║
║  fix in _extract_realized_dollars: same class of defect (unreconciled mark  ║
║  treated as realized), opposite sign.                                      ║
║                                                                              ║
║  FIX (accounting only — NO guardrail was loosened):                        ║
║    1. New accumulator live_daily_realized; resolve_open_orders() adds the   ║
║       reconciled _extract_realized_dollars() result of each MATCHED settled ║
║       trade to it. Open/unsettled positions contribute 0.                  ║
║    2. daily_loss_check() reads live_daily_realized in LIVE mode (was the    ║
║       balance−start cash delta). DEMO path (paper_daily_pnl) was already    ║
║       realized-only and unchanged.                                         ║
║    3. live_daily_realized resets with daily_pnl on UTC rollover and boot.   ║
║    4. Portfolio/heartbeat lines now report realized PnL as the PnL figure   ║
║       and show the cash delta separately as "cash=", so an open position    ║
║       can never again look like a daily loss in the logs.                  ║

║  ROOT CAUSE — three doctrine guards had drifted open (all from the v9.0.6   ║
║  "throughput" push, retained through v9.2.0). Together they manufacture a    ║
║  fake 25% edge on what is really a coin flip, then bet the full per-trade    ║
║  cap on it:                                                                  ║
║    1. run_decision() had NO NEUTRAL gate. Only CONFLICT was blocked; the     ║
║       v9.1.0 note "removed the RECOVERY AGREE gate" left ZERO momentum       ║
║       confirmation in ANY state. Trading on OB alone is doctrine "What This  ║
║       Bot Will Never Do" item 1 — the exact setup post-mortemed in v6.0.0    ║
║       (50% loss, 2026-03-27/28).                                            ║
║    2. NEUTRAL_ACCURACY_DRAG=0.0 → win_prob never discounted flat BTC, so a   ║
║       coin-flip market scored 0.72–0.75 (logs: mom=-0.000). "Edge" =         ║
║       win_prob − price was therefore fictional.                            ║
║    3. compute_confidence() gave NEUTRAL +8 pts. The 06-20 08:30 trade        ║
║       scored Conf=65 EXACTLY on mom=8.0; at the doctrine value of 2.0 it is  ║
║       59 < 65 and never trades.                                            ║
║                                                                              ║
║  FIX (restore, do not engineer around — zero-trade calm sessions are        ║
║  CORRECT per the doctrine):                                                 ║
║    1. momentum_gate_ok(): doctrine Layer 7. REQUIRE_AGREE_MOMENTUM (default  ║
║       true) rejects NEUTRAL and CONFLICT in EVERY session state. Applied in  ║
║       run_decision() right after the momentum verdict.                      ║
║    2. NEUTRAL_ACCURACY_DRAG default 0.0 → 0.02 (honest win_prob if the gate  ║
║       is ever disabled).                                                     ║
║    3. compute_confidence(): NEUTRAL 8.0 → 2.0 (doctrine Layer 8: momentum    ║
║       only scores when AGREE).                                              ║
║    4. Restore drifted thresholds to doctrine: OB_IMBALANCE_THRESH 0.64→0.70, ║
║       R2_TREND_THRESHOLD 0.62→0.65, MIN_CONFIDENCE 60→65,                    ║
║       YES_BREAKEVEN_PRICE 78→67.                                            ║

║  The recovery deadlock that justified removing the AGREE gate is ALREADY     ║
║  solved independently by update_session_state()'s balance-heal exit and     ║
║  RECOVERY_MAX_SECS wall-clock backstop, so re-blocking NEUTRAL cannot        ║

# The 40% SESSION_STOP_FRACTION catastrophic halt is always on, independent of

# straight from RECOVERY_TRADE_SIZE back to the full NORMAL_TRADE_SIZE on the very
# next trade; a single full-size loss then wiped ~5 small wins and re-armed
# recovery. RECOVERY_LADDER_PAUSE_TRADES only held the ladder *multiplier* at 1×,
# not the base, so it never kept the stake small.
#
# Instead, when recovery clears we do NOT jump back to full size. We re-enter at
# the recovery base and climb a ladder of sub-full base sizes, advancing exactly
# one rung when the edge re-proves itself (a short win streak OR a rolling
# win-rate threshold — whichever fires first) and stepping one rung DOWN on any
# loss. Reaching full size graduates back to normal mode. Throughout the ramp the

# RECOVERY MODE  (two-tier position sizing — v9.5.0)
#
# After a FULL-SIZE (normal-mode) trade settles a LOSS, the bot drops to a
# reduced RECOVERY_TRADE_SIZE until the account balance climbs back to where it
# was IMMEDIATELY BEFORE that losing trade. Then it returns to NORMAL_TRADE_SIZE
# automatically. The state (active flag + recovery target balance) is persisted
# to disk so an in-container restart resumes mid-recovery.
#
# Design guarantees (see also the edge-case notes in TRADING_DOCTRINE.md §6):
#   • Entry is event-driven (a settled full-size loss), so the target is the
#     exact recorded pre-trade balance — never reconstructed from PnL.
#   • Exit is balance-driven and checked every cycle AND on boot, so the bot can
#     never wedge in recovery once balance reaches the target even once.
#   • enter() is a no-op while already active → a further loss never moves the
#     target (the goal stays the original pre-loss balance).
#   • Single-threaded loop → mutate-then-persist is atomic w.r.t. sizing reads;
#     there is no race and no per-cycle oscillation (entry needs a settlement).
# This `recovery` object is mutated IN-PLACE only and must NEVER be reassigned
# (so it never appears in a function `global` statement — same rule as the other
# module-level mutable containers above).
