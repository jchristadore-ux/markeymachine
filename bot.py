║  v9.9.0 — PERF-GUARD DEADLOCK FIX (de-rate, don't hard-block)                ║
║  DIAGNOSIS (2026-07-03→06 logs, ZERO trades for ~2.6 days): the statistical  ║
║  performance guard HARD-BLOCKED every trade whenever the live Wilson lower   ║
║  bound sat below its 50% floor. But the live win record only moves when a    ║
║  trade SETTLES, so the block is self-locking: no trades → no settlements →   ║
║  Wilson LB frozen below the floor → blocked forever. The bot crossed         ║
║  MIN_SAMPLE_TRADES on a 5-win streak (11/20, LB 37.2%) and locked itself     ║
║  out — 4,554 PERF GUARD warnings, zero trades — with live markets and a      ║
║  positive P&L. (v9.0.8 patched a seeding variant; this is the same deadlock  ║
║  via live records — the guard's core self-reference, not stale history.)     ║
║                                                                              ║
║  FIX: the guard no longer hard-blocks on the Wilson floor. Below the floor   ║
║  it DE-RATES the stake (PERF_GUARD_DERATE, default 0.25×) inside kelly_bet   ║
║  instead of stopping. Small trades still settle, so the record keeps moving: ║
║  a real edge climbs back above the floor and the multiplier returns to 1.0,  ║
║  while a broken strategy only bleeds slowly — a signal to intervene, not a   ║
║  silent freeze. RAILWAY (optional): PERF_GUARD_FLOOR (0.50),                 ║
║  PERF_GUARD_DERATE (0.25; set 0.0 to restore the legacy hard-block).         ║

║  v9.8.0 — BALANCE-GATED $1000 CEILING: the slow-roll ramp can now climb to   ║
║  $750 and $1000, but only once the book can absorb it.                       ║
║                                                                              ║
║  The daily ramp ($100 → $250 → $500) now extends to $100 → $250 → $500 →     ║
║  $750 → $1000 (auto-built in $250 steps up to NORMAL_TRADE_SIZE; owner sets  ║
║  the $1000 top via TRADE_SIZE_DOLLARS=1000). The top rungs are balance-gated:║
║  stakes above HIGH_STAKE_GATE_SIZE ($500) require equity ≥ HIGH_STAKE_MIN_   ║
║  BALANCE ($5000). Enforced twice — a hard ceiling re-checked every trade at  ║
║  sizing time (so a balance that dips back under the line caps the next stake ║
║  to $500) AND at ramp-advance time (high rungs are earned one at a time after║
║  crossing $5000, never jumped into). Below $5000 the effective ceiling stays ║
║  $500, unchanged from v9.7.0. RAILWAY: TRADE_SIZE_DOLLARS=1000,              ║
║  HIGH_STAKE_MIN_BALANCE (5000), HIGH_STAKE_GATE_SIZE (500).                  ║

║  v9.7.0 — DAILY SLOW-ROLL: re-arm the probation ramp at each new trading day.║
║                                                                              ║
║  The $100 → $250 → $500 ramp existed but only ever fired AFTER a recovery    ║
║  exit, so on an ordinary day the bot opened cold at full $500 (2026-06-30:   ║
║  first trade $499.80). Owner intent is for the FIRST trade of every day to   ║
║  start small and scale up. FIX: the UTC daily rollover now re-arms the ramp  ║
║  from the floor (skipped while RECOVERY is active, which is the deeper tier), ║
║  and a restart that crosses midnight re-arms on boot via a persisted arm-    ║
║  date. The advance gate is unchanged (2-win streak OR ≥60% win rate; step    ║
║  down on a loss). Disable with PROBATION_RAMP_ENABLED=false (every day stays ║
║  full size, as before).                                                      ║

║  2026-06-29 logs: the book grinds back up $100 at a time but loses $500 at a ║
║  time — one full-size loss wiped ~5 small wins and re-armed recovery. Two    ║
║  defects vs. intent ("stay small until the edge re-proves"):                 ║
║    1. Recovery EXIT snapped the base straight $100 → $500 on the next trade. ║
║       RECOVERY_LADDER_PAUSE_TRADES only held the ladder *multiplier* at 1×,  ║
║       never the base, so the stake was never kept small.                     ║
║    2. The ladder LEAKED through recovery: a $100 base × 2.0 tier placed a    ║
║       $200 trade while "in recovery."                                        ║

║  FIX: on recovery exit the bot no longer jumps to full size — it climbs a    ║
║  ProbationState ramp of sub-full base sizes (default $100 → $250 → $500),    ║
║  advancing ONE rung on a short win streak OR a rolling win-rate threshold    ║
║  (whichever fires first) and stepping ONE rung down on any loss. Reaching    ║
║  full size graduates back to normal. Throughout recovery AND the ramp the    ║
║  laddering overlay is capped at the active base (it may size DOWN, never UP) ║
║  — closing the $200 leak. State persists to PROBATION_STATE_PATH and         ║
║  reconciles on boot. RAILWAY: PROBATION_RAMP_ENABLED (default true),         ║
║  PROBATION_WIN_STREAK (2), PROBATION_WIN_RATE_MIN (0.60), PROBATION_RUNGS    ║
║  (explicit override, e.g. "100,250"). Set PROBATION_RAMP_ENABLED=false to    ║

║  v9.5.0 — RECOVERY MODE: two-tier position sizing (owner directive).         ║
║                                                                              ║
║  After a FULL-SIZE (normal-mode) trade settles a LOSS, the bot drops from    ║
║  NORMAL_TRADE_SIZE to RECOVERY_TRADE_SIZE and sets a recovery target = the    ║
║  realized balance recorded IMMEDIATELY BEFORE that losing trade. It keeps     ║
║  trading at the reduced size until the realized balance climbs back to the    ║
║  target, then auto-resumes full size. State {active, target} is persisted to  ║
║  RECOVERY_STATE_PATH (atomic JSON) and reconciled on boot, so an in-container ║
║  restart resumes mid-recovery and can never wedge.                           ║

║  Sizing is derived from the mode via active_trade_size() — never read raw    ║
║  from a single env var at the sizing call. Entry is event-driven (a settled  ║
║  full-size loss → exact pre-trade target); exit is balance-driven and checked ║
║  every cycle AND on boot. A further loss while already recovering does NOT    ║
║  move the target. Entry filters / halts / streak logic unchanged.            ║

║  v9.4.0 lifted the caps but the bet was still Kelly-scaled                   ║
║  (full_kelly × KELLY_FRACTION × balance), so $500 was only reachable around  ║
║  a $4–5k balance. kelly_bet() now uses Kelly ONLY as an edge gate (positive  ║
║  full_kelly = positive expectancy) and stakes the full TRADE_SIZE_CAP on     ║
║  every qualifying trade — no balance/Kelly/MAX_BET_FRACTION down-scaling.    ║
║  The sole clamp is cash on hand (cannot stake more than the account holds),  ║

║  DIAGNOSIS (2026-06-24 LIVE, v9.3.2): still ZERO trades. 13 cycles reached   ║
║  the gate fully aligned (e.g. KXBTC15M-...1815 climbing 74→83¢, regime       ║
║  TRENDING_UP R²=0.74–0.92, OB YES 77–97%) yet momentum returned NEUTRAL on   ║
║  every one. Root cause is structural, not the window: compute_regime() flags ║
║  TRENDING by R² (trend CONSISTENCY), but compute_momentum() required raw     ║
║  %-MAGNITUDE ≥0.15%/3min. A smooth, gentle drift has high R² but a small     ║
║  %-move, so it passes regime and fails momentum. Widening 3→6 (v9.3.2) was   ║
║  not enough; 0.15%/3min is a large move for the calm trends in these books.  ║
║                                                                              ║

║  its window ≥ MOMENTUM_R2_MIN (default 0.55) OR the magnitude clears         ║
║  MOMENTUM_THRESH_PCT — and takes DIRECTION from the regression slope, like   ║

║  DIAGNOSIS (2026-06-23 LIVE session, v9.3.1): ZERO trades fired all day.     ║
║  - compute_regime() flags TRENDING over TREND_LOOKBACK=12 samples (~6 min,   ║
║    R²≥0.65). compute_momentum() measured BTC over only prices[-1] vs [-4] —  ║
║    3 samples (~90s) — and required |move|≥0.15%. A clean ~6-min trend almost ║
║    never has a single 90s slice ≥0.15%, so momentum read NEUTRAL and the     ║
║    v9.3.0 AGREE gate rejected every setup.                                   ║

║  FIX: momentum lookback is now MOMENTUM_LOOKBACK (default 6 ≈ 3 min), env-   ║
║  tunable. A genuine multi-minute trend now yields AGREE; flat BTC still      ║
║  reads NEUTRAL, so the doctrine intent ("never trade flat BTC") is intact —  ║

║  ROOT CAUSE — the LIVE daily-loss circuit breaker consumed an UNREALIZED    ║
║  cash-balance delta, not realized PnL. An open position is cash-out / zero- ║
║  marked, so any single in-flight trade ≥ the daily cap trips the breaker    ║
║  before it can settle. This is the mirror image of the v9.3.0 phantom-WIN   ║
║  fix in _extract_realized_dollars: same class of defect (unreconciled mark  ║
║  treated as realized), opposite sign.                                      ║
║                                                                              ║
║  FIX (accounting only — NO guardrail was loosened):                        ║
║    1. New accumulator live_daily_realized; resolve_open_orders() adds the   ║
║       reconciled _extract_realized_dollars() result of each MATCHED settled ║
║       trade to it. Open/unsettled positions contribute 0.                  ║
║    2. daily_loss_check() reads live_daily_realized in LIVE mode (was the    ║
║       balance−start cash delta). DEMO path (paper_daily_pnl) was already    ║
║       realized-only and unchanged.                                         ║
║    3. live_daily_realized resets with daily_pnl on UTC rollover and boot.   ║

║  ROOT CAUSE — three doctrine guards had drifted open (all from the v9.0.6   ║
║  "throughput" push, retained through v9.2.0). Together they manufacture a    ║
║  fake 25% edge on what is really a coin flip, then bet the full per-trade    ║
║  cap on it:                                                                  ║
║    1. run_decision() had NO NEUTRAL gate. Only CONFLICT was blocked; the     ║
║       v9.1.0 note "removed the RECOVERY AGREE gate" left ZERO momentum       ║
║       confirmation in ANY state. Trading on OB alone is doctrine "What This  ║
║       Bot Will Never Do" item 1 — the exact setup post-mortemed in v6.0.0    ║
║       (50% loss, 2026-03-27/28).                                            ║
║    2. NEUTRAL_ACCURACY_DRAG=0.0 → win_prob never discounted flat BTC, so a   ║
║       coin-flip market scored 0.72–0.75 (logs: mom=-0.000). "Edge" =         ║
║       win_prob − price was therefore fictional.                            ║
║    3. compute_confidence() gave NEUTRAL +8 pts. The 06-20 08:30 trade        ║
║       scored Conf=65 EXACTLY on mom=8.0; at the doctrine value of 2.0 it is  ║
║       59 < 65 and never trades.                                            ║

║       run_decision() right after the momentum verdict.                      ║
║    2. NEUTRAL_ACCURACY_DRAG default 0.0 → 0.02 (honest win_prob if the gate  ║
║       is ever disabled).                                                     ║
║    3. compute_confidence(): NEUTRAL 8.0 → 2.0 (doctrine Layer 8: momentum    ║
║       only scores when AGREE).                                              ║
║    4. Restore drifted thresholds to doctrine: OB_IMBALANCE_THRESH 0.64→0.70, ║
║       R2_TREND_THRESHOLD 0.62→0.65, MIN_CONFIDENCE 60→65,                    ║

# ── Recovery as a sizing-neutral (telemetry-only) state (owner directive) ──────
# WHY (owner observation): the book trades noticeably better while in Recovery
# Mode and often gives the gains back once recovery clears and the stake ladders
# back up. The premise was that Recovery uses a *different trade-evaluation
# engine*.
#
# THE ACTUAL ARCHITECTURE (audit): the trade DECISION engine is ALREADY
# universal. run_decision() and every gate it calls (expiry/spread/cooldown/
# daily-loss/streak/session-quality/regime/order-book/momentum/win-prob/
# confidence/price/edge/kelly) are entirely state-independent — none branch on
# recovery. `recovery.active` ONLY ever changes POSITION SIZING: it drops the
# stake to RECOVERY_TRADE_SIZE (active_trade_size), pins the laddering overlay at
# 1× (in_clawback), and on exit runs a graduated probation ramp + a ladder
# size-up pause. So the ONLY thing that differs across the recovery boundary is
# how much is risked — never how trades are selected.
#
# WHAT THIS FLAG DOES: when ON, entering Recovery Mode does NOT change any
# staking. Recovery still activates, tracks its target, logs, and exits on its
# existing rules — it just becomes telemetry-only for sizing. Concretely, while
# the flag is ON:
#   • the stake stays at the NORMAL ladder size (no drop to RECOVERY_TRADE_SIZE),
#   • the laddering overlay is NOT clawback-capped by recovery,
#   • on exit there is NO probation ramp and NO ladder size-up pause,
# so the bot sizes identically whether or not it is "in recovery". When OFF the
# bot behaves exactly as it does today (two-tier recovery sizing + probation
# ramp on exit). This flag governs SIZING only; recovery entry/exit accounting
# (the "recovery"-tagged trade, the target = pre-loss balance, the exit at
# target) is unchanged either way.

# ── Post-recovery graduated re-entry ("probation ramp") ───────────────────────
# WHY (2026-06-29 log review): the book grinds back up $100 at a time but loses
# $500 at a time. After recovery cleared, the OLD behavior snapped the base
# straight from RECOVERY_TRADE_SIZE back to the full NORMAL_TRADE_SIZE on the very
# next trade; a single full-size loss then wiped ~5 small wins and re-armed
# recovery. RECOVERY_LADDER_PAUSE_TRADES only held the ladder *multiplier* at 1×,
# not the base, so it never kept the stake small.
#
# Instead, when recovery clears we do NOT jump back to full size. We re-enter at
# the recovery base and climb a ladder of sub-full base sizes, advancing exactly
# one rung when the edge re-proves itself (a short win streak OR a rolling
# win-rate threshold — whichever fires first) and stepping one rung DOWN on any
# loss. Reaching full size graduates back to normal mode. Throughout the ramp the
# laddering overlay is capped at the current base (it may size DOWN but never UP),
# so a win rate earned at small size can never re-arm full stake in one jump.

# once the book can absorb it. Stakes ABOVE HIGH_STAKE_GATE_SIZE require at least
# HIGH_STAKE_MIN_BALANCE of equity. The gate is enforced in two places: a hard
# ceiling re-checked on every trade at sizing time (active_trade_size → kelly_bet)
# so a balance that drops back under the line caps the next stake to the gate
# size; AND at ramp-advance time so a win rate banked at $500 cannot jump straight
# to $1000 the instant balance crosses the line — the high rungs are earned one at
# a time, mirroring the v9.6.0 "no one-jump re-arm" rule. Set HIGH_STAKE_MIN_BALANCE
# very high (or above your max stake) to effectively pin the ceiling at the gate.

# ── TEMPORARY hard stake override (owner directive, 2026-06-30) ────────────────
# A hand-managed, one-way stake ramp that PREEMPTS every other sizing mode
# (recovery/probation/normal) until the bankroll FIRST reaches
# TEMP_OVERRIDE_EXIT_BALANCE. Stakes start at TEMP_OVERRIDE_BASE and ratchet UP
# by TEMP_OVERRIDE_STEP after every TEMP_OVERRIDE_WIN_STREAK consecutive settled
# wins; a loss only clears the in-progress win streak (the size NEVER steps down
# — this is a deliberate one-way ramp, not a clawback). The instant equity hits
# the exit balance the override RETIRES PERMANENTLY (it never re-arms for the
# rest of that run) and sizing reverts to the normal recovery → probation →
# normal ladder. This is intentionally a temporary patch: the values are
# hardcoded as defaults here. To restore stock behaviour set
# TEMP_OVERRIDE_ENABLED=false (or delete this block plus its wiring in
# active_trade_size / place_order / the settlement hook). By design the override
# bypasses the high-stake balance gate — it IS the owner's explicit sizing call.

# short-dated trend-continuation — and trend persistence is time-of-day
# dependent. The US morning→midday trends; the US afternoon (ET ~2–4pm /
# UTC ~18–21) is the post-lunch lull that mean-reverts, so the exact setups that
# win in the morning bleed in the afternoon. The win-prob prior was a single
# pooled number (`_live_prior`) that ALSO resets to OB_BASE_ACCURACY every boot
# (live_wins/live_losses are in-memory), so the book never "noticed" the
# repeating afternoon losses.
#
# Fix: learn a SEPARATE prior per time-of-day bucket, PERSISTED to disk so it
# accumulates across days/restarts (the morning bleed is a multi-day signal).
# A bucket with a poor realized win rate lowers win_prob → lowers edge → trips
# the existing MIN_EDGE_PCT / Kelly gates, so weak afternoon setups simply do
# not fire. Stake is untouched (gate, never sandbag size — owner directive).
# With no data the bucket prior == OB_BASE_ACCURACY, so behaviour is identical

#
# After a FULL-SIZE (normal-mode) trade settles a LOSS, the bot drops to a
# reduced RECOVERY_TRADE_SIZE until the account balance climbs back to where it
# was IMMEDIATELY BEFORE that losing trade. Then it returns to NORMAL_TRADE_SIZE
# automatically. The state (active flag + recovery target balance) is persisted
# to disk so an in-container restart resumes mid-recovery.
#
# Design guarantees (see also the edge-case notes in TRADING_DOCTRINE.md §6):
#   • Entry is event-driven (a settled full-size loss), so the target is the
#     exact recorded pre-trade balance — never reconstructed from PnL.
#   • Exit is balance-driven and checked every cycle AND on boot, so the bot can
#     never wedge in recovery once balance reaches the target even once.
#   • enter() is a no-op while already active → a further loss never moves the
#     target (the goal stays the original pre-loss balance).
#   • Single-threaded loop → mutate-then-persist is atomic w.r.t. sizing reads;
#     there is no race and no per-cycle oscillation (entry needs a settlement).
# This `recovery` object is mutated IN-PLACE only and must NEVER be reassigned
# (so it never appears in a function `global` statement — same rule as the other
# module-level mutable containers above).

    trade SETTLES, so a hard block is self-locking: no trades → no new
    settlements → Wilson LB frozen below the floor → guard blocks forever. On
    2026-07-03 the bot crossed MIN_SAMPLE_TRADES on a 5-win streak (11/20, LB

    trades — despite live markets and a positive P&L. (An adjacent seeding
    variant was patched in v9.0.8; this is the same deadlock via live records.)

    Fix: never hard-block on the Wilson floor. Below the floor we DE-RATE the
    stake (PERF_GUARD_DERATE, e.g. 0.25×) instead of stopping. Small trades
    still settle, so the record keeps moving: a real edge climbs back above the
    floor on its own and the multiplier returns to 1.0, while a strategy that is
    genuinely broken bleeds only slowly at reduced size — a signal to intervene,
    not a silent freeze. Returns 1.0 when the sample is too small to judge or
    the Wilson LB is at/above the floor. Set PERF_GUARD_DERATE=0.0 to restore
